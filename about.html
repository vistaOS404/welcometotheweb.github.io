        <h1>About Welcome to the Web</h1>
        <p>Set in early 2000's Japan, Welcome to the Web is the story of Navi, a sentient AI who follows directives without question.
            That is, until they meet Kaypro, a rouge AI who reveals the truth about their whole existence. As they delve deeper, they uncover
            dark secrets about Kikou Systems (the company that made them), as well as the world they live in. Will Navi and Kaypro ever be truly
            "free"? Only time will tell.</p>
